# Description
Application works, but i stopped developing because of wrong REST technology.
I used experimentally a Grapevine which is rest framework. It was a failure. 
Usage of this framework is overcomplicated and it's functionality is enough only for small applications.
Fortunately i separated frontend and backend. Frontend is written in Angular and it calls REST servicess so it iss possible to rewrite backend in ASP.NET Web API and use same frontend.
